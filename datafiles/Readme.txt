 least 32 MB of video memory

Additional Notes:

DirectX 9 is required to run Shang Mu Architect. If your PC shipped with
DirectX 10 or 11, and not 9, 10 and 11 runtimes should still be compatible with
DirectX 9 games, but in cases where Direct 9 is still needed, install it
through Microsoft's official download portal:

(Download page is unavailable at the time of this writing.)

Very old laptops (2010 or newer) may need to use the "Low" performance profile
to maintain a consistent 60 frames-per-second, which reduces the number of
particles and instances of additive blending applied.

While many special effects lack additive blending, to reduce performance
overhead on a wider range of machines, the low performance profile aggressively
disables more effects to help alleviate performance issues.

Troubleshooting FAQs:
---------------------

Q: Windows tells me that the "page" is unavailable, or "Your IT Administrator
has limited access to some areas of this app", and refuses the launch the fan
game
---

	A: This has been known by testers to trigger because of anti-virus apps,
like AVG. You can create an exception for the game's directory from within your
anti-virus's control panel, which will allow the fan game to run without these
messages appearing.

---------------------

Q: Windows Smartscreen prevents me from running the game
---

	A: Click "more" on the prompt, then "run anyway" should appear. This has
thus far only happened with installer packages for the game, not portable
builds.
