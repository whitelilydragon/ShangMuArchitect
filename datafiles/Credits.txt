Shang Mu Architect was not produced entirely alone! A lot of wonderful people
have directly made great contributions to the project's goals. This fan game
has greatly benefitted from Game Maker extensions, as well.

Below is a detailed list of everyone who left their mark on this fan game!

Research Credits:
-----------------

Speedrunners who have provided their information and observations of the
original game: If credit for information you have contributed is missing,
please send an email with your alias and a summary of your data, so the credits
list can be updated.

SuccinctAndPunchy, Fladervy, Revolucion, Tris, Deckard, El_Nacho, and
NitroSplint - Movement and frama data on Lilac, Carol, and Milla.

Vibel - Documented Milla's advanced behavior in a PDF for beginners on
Speedrun.com. This was immensely helpful in recreating Milla's flutter block
tech, because I previously couldn't perform it on my own

Fladervy - Created the FTrainer that was used to gather troves of frame
data for the characters via its advanced data view. It was an invaluable tool
in the process of developing this game.

Operator1997 - Provided hundreds of personal photos from visits to Japan, to
help inspire the Japanese-leaning art direction for the project. Many assets
for the game were drawn based on real-life artifacts, architecture, and various
objects from Japan! Thank you, friend!

Artist Credits
--------------

While I did as much work as I could, other artists helped along the way,
and they gave me a higher quality bar to aim for with the game's original
assets. I learned a lot from their contributions!

troopsushi - Created an promotional poster for SMA, created the game's logo
from scratch, improved some original assets, designed Lilac's maker outfit, and
greatly improved a work-in-progress background. Troop even inspired the shading
style that all of the girls have in the game! Thank you so much for your help!
---
You can find more of TroopSushi's work here, as well as his work on his
original game project, DownSouth!

WizToad - In general reshaded a lot of Shang Mu Architect's original assets,
and gave it a much needed level of polish that was beyond my skill level. Thank
you so much for your help!

Prototype (Starbuster developer) - Created an entirely new background for Shang
Mu Architect! We called it Liyu Lagoon, and it is a wonderful addition to the
game. I am still so floored to see Proto's work in a Freedom Planet setting;
his art style works so well with it, you would assume the background came from
Freedom Planet 2 itself! Thank you, friend!
---

Treylina - She has generally been an assistant pixel artist, colorist, and
concept artist for various aspects of the project; Treylina even made new
sprites for Spade. Any non-player characters that look especially good, you
can likely thank Treylina for that! Thank you, friend!
---
You can follow her work on Twitter!
https://twitter.com/TreyaZerros/

PicsandPixels - Pixy handled cleanup work for Chiasa's sprites, as well as
having professionally worked on the Freedom Planet 1 assets that Shang Mu
Architect has borrowed. Pixy's wonderful to work with, she brings a lot of
goodness to every project!

HyperTails12 - Did a lot of spriting to help bring Carrie to life in Shang Mu
Architect, as well as provided NPCs for the game. Thank you, friend!

https://twitter.com/HyperTails12

23Lief - Lief has done substantial work for the fan game, producing Lilac's
*and* Milla's alt outfits, as well as various NPCs' assets! Lief is also
responsible for fully animating Chiasa, so that she could become SMA's sixth
fully playable character. (Instead of only the NPC sprites I produced for
Chiasa.)

We can thank Lief for many of the NPCs having sprites at all, as well as
quality shading for them!
---
You can follow his sprite work on Twitter!

RocketPotato - Worked on a lot of concept art for the game, as well as entirely
new NPCs and boss sprites. Thank you so much, friend!

HyperWerefox - Created FP1-styled versions of some of Carol's FP2 attacks and
animations, which they offered for me to use in Shang Mu Architect! Thank you!
---

SlayerS - Produced new scenery pieces for various tile sets, as well as some
new NPCs. Every piece helps build a complete game, thank you for your time,
Slayer!

Composer Credits
----------------

Woofle - Gave me her blessing to use "Aqua Surface", a fantastic track that
felt right as the game's main theme. It is exciting and humbling to have a
musical piece from Freedom Planet's own composer in this fan game. Thank you!
---
If you are interested in hearing more of Woofle's work, here is a link to other
places where you can find her music:
https://leilawilson.bandcamp.com/
https://soundcloud.com/leila-wilson-woofle

benjistring - Remixed many of Freedom Planet's songs for Shang Mu Architect, as
well as created an outstanding remix of Blitz Lunar's Kimono Witch's Castle!
SMA's OST would still be sorely lacking if not for him, he is the sole reason
we have a diverse range of music for the game!

Blitz Lunar - Gave permission to use his song "Kimono Witch's Castle". It is an
amazing, fun piece of music that I'm honored to use for Shang Mu Architect,
thank you!

Dusky (HavocFox developer) - Gave permission to use her outstanding Aqua Tunnel
remix and Fortune Night Elevator theme! She has also composed a new arrangement
of the mid-boss theme!

Dusky is a fantastic artist, and she has an equally strong footing in
her composing work! I'm honored to have her work in this game, thank you so
much! (She's also created excellent alt color palettes for Lilac, Carol, Milla,
Carrie, and even Chiasa!)

BobTheGUYYYYY - Remixed Zao Land and Trap Hideout for a lively daytime variant
of the West District theme! Much like Bob's artwork, his music is fantastic.
I'm so happy he took the time to contribute such a great remix for this fan
game!

as rearranged the Results Screen's theme and Shang Mu Palace theme! I'm very
happy to hear new takes on these themes, thank you!

Alestance - Contributed a new arrangement of Fortune Night, which brings an
appreciably fresh atmosphere to the game! (Alestance also made all of the
assets for the Fireworks Tank boss, and composed the original theme for
Taishan Mountain!) Thank you!

JJ MH (Ghost) - Composed a new song for the fan game! I can't wait to find a
fitting place for it to be in the game, thank you, Ghost!

Voice Acting Credits
--------------------

Akkuyo1116 - Voiced Carrie the Wild Cat's in-game voice clips, and to great
effect, too! Thank you for giving Carrie a voice of her own, Akkuyo!

Velacosmos - I voiced Pixel myself! It was fun.

Testing Credits
---------------

Kain, Nacho, Scootles, SaladPants, Prototype, Eps, NBlast, Tris, Deckard,
NitroSplint, benjistring, Noone, Frisktaker - Testing, and generally
invaluable feedback throughout the fan game's development.

Scootles and Nacho caught so many hilarious, amusing bugs that I would have
never spotted on my own; I want to thank all of you for your time.

Scootles - Co-author of the Tile-Collision Mask Editor. Wrote most, if not all,
of the program's algorithms and backend code. I learned a lot while
collaborating with Scootles! Much of the drawing algorithms are still used for
Shang Mu Architect's drawing tools, too!

Stage Design Credits
--------------------

Quite a few of our testers made their own complete levels to be included in
Shang Mu Architect! I want to thank them all for their time!

Programming Credits
-------------------

Co-credit for SMA's update launcher goes to Leo! He was a big help with its
production, and even produced his alternative launcher built in Python:

https://github.com/Leo40Git/SMALauncher

Leo is also responsible for the game's SMAMapListHelper applet, as well as the
fan game's shine new SMAFS extension, which greatly streamlines the game's file
management functionality on the backend.

Another one of Leo's projects is a SMA rolling build scraper bot for Discord,
which automatically grabs every weekly rolling build and uploads them publicly
onto its own GitHub page. This is both public access outside of Discord, and
assisting the fan game's launcher in keeping users up-to-date!

You can find more of his work here!

Asset Ripping
-------------

RandomTalkingBush, Okamikurainya, Segatendo, and others created well organized
sheets of their sprite rips from the original game on The Spriter's Resource.
Their work saved me countless hours I would have otherwise spent ripping
everything myself.

Dazl - Provided a raw PNG dump of all of the game's graphics assets in a zip
archive. While this was rather dizzying to navigate, it was immensely helpful
in extracting clean rips of many sprites that have additive alpha-blending
applied to them in the game. It would have taken a lot of time to recreate
those sprites without this dump.

snickerbockers - Created the Freedom Planet extractor/archiver tool, which
allowed others to provide me a ZIP of all the sound effects in the game. (I was
too green in regards to Python to use it myself, unfortunately.) While I
did record every sound effect I could directly from the game itself, they had
too much bass compared to their source files, so this helped improve the
quality of the sound effects in the engine itself

Extension Credits
-----------------

YellowAfterLife - Produced the NSFS extension that Shang Mu Architect depends
on, to free the game from Game Maker's sandbox; this allows maps and
configuration files to be retrieved from the game's local folder, instead of
the userdata folder. This greatly simplifies sharing maps! I don't know what I
would have done without YellowAfterLife's work

PixelatedPope - Produced the retro palette swapper shader that Shang Mu
Architect is using to restore Lilac's, Carol's, and Milla's lost alt palettes
from Freedom Planet 1! Thank you! It's also now being used to invert the
sprites of enemies when they're hurt! This shader is priceless!

Dazl also gifted me with YellowAfterLife's Apollo Lua scripting extension, to
hopefully open up the possibilities of supporting mods for Shang Mu Architect!
Thank you, friend!

omicronrex - Created the great gms_scheduler_fix extension that allows SMA to
function on more recent versions of Windows 10 without slowdowns or resorting
to alt sync. (Which proved buggy for our testers on Windows 10.)

I felt so lost after years of working on the game, only for recent Windows 10
updates to break everything I had worked so hard to put together. omicronrex
saved this project!

skyfloogle - Created the gmsched extension for Studio 1.4, backporting Studio
2.3.2's handling of the Windows scheduler for older versions of Game Maker! I
plan to make great use of it for this project, once I understand how to use it
effectively.

This extension will also save Shang Mu Architect in the long run! Thank you so
much for helping many of us, who have years-long projects that can't be ported
to Game Maker Studio 2 easily

1up fairies for Spade, generally invaluable feedback, as well as alt color
palettes for Lilac, Carol, Milla, and Spade! Thank you so much for your help,
friend!
