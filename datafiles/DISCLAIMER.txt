This is a fan game created specially for the purpose of reviving the scrapped
level editor that was originally planned for "Freedom Planet", which is an
intellectual-property (IP) of GalaxyTrail. It is specialized in simulating
behavior unique to the characters and world featured in "Freedom Planet", based
on hundreds of hours of research and observation.

This fan game is in no way endorsed, promoted, connected to, associated with,
or supported by GalaxyTrail in any shape or form. Please support the official
games.
